        <strong>Emphatize</strong>
        <p>First phase of my design process is understanding the problem space and getting to know more about the audience whom I’m designing for. To achieve that, first I conducted <b> a competitive analysis </b> to see how other similar apps solve
          user’s
          problems.
        </p>
        <p>Then to better understand user’s problem and needs I conducted <b>user research</b> to gather valuable feedbacks from potential users. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <strong>Define</strong>
        <p>Based on the feedbacks of potential users and results of the survey, I created two main personas and determined <b>user needs, goals, behaviour</b> and <b>emotions</b>.

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <strong>Ideate</strong>
        <p>Based on the learnings, I defined <b>the problem</b> and identified <b>the possible solutions</b> and created <b>flows</b> to outlines the journey user will take to complete tasks.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <strong>Prototype</strong>
        <p>Based on flows, I started to <b>visualize my solutions</b> by sketching and then started creating low to high fidelity prototypes.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <strong>Test</strong>
        <p>Without dedicating too much time to visual design, I tested <b>high-fi prototype</b> with potential users in order to see how they interact with my product, what works and what doesn’t work.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <strong>Iterate</strong>
        <p>I iterated my design considering the usability test and the preference test insights, the feedback I gathered from my tutor and other UX design students at Career Foundry. I also took into consideration visual design principle during these
          iterations.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="morespace">I conducted both user survey and user interviews with pet parents. It was suprising that the vast majority of pet parents are willing to eliminate their concerns without taking their pets to a clinic but asking pet
          parents and doing web search.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>Pet parents are not able to take their pets to a vet clinic on every issue because; <br>
          <br>i. they don’t want their pets to get stressed for nothing
          <br> ii. they don’t want to allocate a lot of time which takes hours including waiting period.
        </p>
        <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
        <p> Designing a web app enables users to get health consultation from a verified and reliable pet expert and also offers a feature to book an online appointment to a vet clinic.</p>

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>This project was an incredible experience as I had the chance to learn UX and UI by applying every stage of the Design Thinking Process. Working on the project alone and learning every aspect of UX was challenging but it came with
          learnings too.</P>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Focusing on the process by following design process, pursuing user-centered design was challenging while trying to learn tools and improve new skills.</li>
          <li>UX requires deep understanding of different disciplines. To have an understanding about every aspect of UX, reading, researching, asking and practicing is crucial and requires time.</li>
          <li>Turning into student and junior again required me to improve my learning skills too.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t be a perfectionist and focus on learning the process and big picture. There is no sense in chasing perfection while trying to learn a new field because trial and error, getting feedback from experienced people, asking for help
            is
            a big part of the learning process.</li>
          <li>Don’t jump into coming up with solutions and visualizing these solutions. User research, understanding why and how people do what, observing and listening carefully is the most important steps of design thinking. </li>
          <li>Don’t reinvent the wheel. If I could go back to the beginning of the project, I would save a significant amount of time by not trying to design icons and dedicate that time to process and reading.</li>
          <li>Creating good UX is not as easy as noticing bad ones. Every element, component, writing, font, color, placement etc need attention. </li>
        </ul>
