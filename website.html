        <p class="morespace">To be able to grasp the limits of technology and better communicate with developers, I took Frontend Development for Designers certified course at Career Foundry.</p>
        <p class="morespace">Having my portfolio website also allowed me to have my personal space to showcase my projects and skills to attract recruiters and managers in the tech world.</p>

        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <p>I began my design process by analyzing other UX Designers’ portfolio websites to get some inspiration and see how they present their work, how is their navigation structure, and what content they have.</p>
        <p class="morespace">Then I decided to use the wireframes provided by the course because it was prepared considering trends and the needs of recruiters and hiring managers. Following same layout with the course also allowed me to focus on
          writing clean and
          readable code.</p>
        <p class="morespace">While following the same structure with the course, I was free to use any styling I wanted to. I decided to use a white background to keep the website legible and readable but bright colors for buttons and project
          screenshots to make them
          easy to notice.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>It was important to keep my navigation simple, clear, and always accessible. For this reason, I used a fixed header and only 3 items on the navigation bar.</p>
        <h4>Challenge #1</h4>
        <p>My initial intention was to have a transparent navigation bar with the same background color as the section below it for every page. I also wanted to adjust the content width to keep it between the logo and menus. This way content and
          elements in the header wouldn’t overlap, menus would still be legible and I would have an appealing header.</p>

            <p>Defining different styling for smaller screen sizes by using media queries didn’t work either because when scrolled JS overrode CSS styling. </p>

        <p><b>The solution:</b> Because my main goal was building a responsive, usable website to showcase my work, design thinking and process, and also my JS skills were limited due to course scope, I decided to use a header with white background

            <h4>Challenge #2</h4>
            <p>For mobile devices, I used a hamburger menu and a transition between states (three bars when closed, X when opened).</p>
            <p class="morespace"><b>The problem:</b> Work and Contact menus were anchor links. Because these links were keeping users on the same page, the hamburger icon didn’t transform to its initial state. </p>

        <p class="morespace"><b>The solution:</b> There were 3 possible solutions;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>using only the bar icon for both states, so there would be no transition and no issue</li>
          <li>using two different headers, one for large screen sizes, one for mobile devices</li>

            <p class="morespace">I didn’t want to choose the first solution because using the X icon when it’s active because it signals to users that they can close the menu by clicking it.</p>
            <p class="morespace">The second solution was time-consuming because it would require me to rewrite my HTML, styling, and JS codes for the header.</p>
            <p class="morespace">So I need to think about a quick fix. I decided to write a code to reverse the hamburger icon transition. What I did was to add classes to anchor links (work & contact) and define a rule to reverse animation of
              hamburger icon when they’re clicked. </p>

        <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
        <p>After I finished coding the first version of my website, I started to conduct usability tests to see how people interact with my website.</p>
        <p>I tried to recruit participants among managers and recruiters who work in a digital agency or an IT company.</p>

            <li>The images on the homepage, about page and project pages, were too large that users’ needed to scroll down to see the content which frustrated all of them.</li>
            <li class="listspace"> The animation at homepage assumed to be another project because it shared the same layout with projects above it.</li>
            <li class="listspace">Hero section at homepage was too flat and text amount in general (hero section and project pages) disturbed 3 participants.</li>
            <li class="listspace">Work link on navigation bar confused users because it was linking to the homepage so nothing happened when they clicked it on the homepage.</li>

        <p>To balance the image and information next to it in the work section, I changed the grids dedicated to image and text.</p>
        <p>I also used 960px max-width instead of 1200px.</p>
        <p>This way people were enabled to see two projects on one page.</p>

        <strong>Issue #2- The animation</strong>

        <strong>Issue #3- The hero section and text amount</strong>
        <p>I redesigned my hero section including my image, a short introduction, and more descriptive links to the work section and about me page. I benefited from different font weights and sizes on text to ease readability and show hierarchy.
